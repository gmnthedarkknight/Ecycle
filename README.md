# built with
Python, flask, solidity, blockchain

#elevator-pitch
E-cycle is a blockchain enabled supply chain and waste management system, which allows tracking of E products for the manufactures and providing incentive for the customers to recycle e products.

# Problem statement
1. Supply chain issues for product manufacturers. Tracking the product throughout the journey.
2. E wastes are given to rag pickers for lower price and not recycled properly in most developing and underdeveloped countries.

# product
So we made a private-blockchain based platform which enables the tracking of supply chain. 
1. We plan on providing incentive for customers to recycle. The manufacturer and suppliers in the chain provide discount coupons and other tokens to encourage the customers to return the product once it has been completely utilized.

# solution
We built the wireframe for back end in python, integrated it with flask and made a beta model with a simple UI. We coded the alpha backend using solidity(a programming language built on Ethereum platform). Then we deployed it on a website called Simbachain which enables us to visualize the blockchain network with a simple UI. We first drew a graph to wireframe our idea and then chose to code it in solidity. 

# how hard was it
We had two back end developers who dropped out of the team last moment and that left us in a mega spot of bother. Yet we gave our best by developing a beta model with the alpha backend though we weren't able to do the front end. 

# achievements
Despite of the issues we faced, and a 100 bugs, and considering that blockchain development is a really complex process, we still worked our way through and built an application that actually works than just another ppt!

# What we learned
We learnt the usage of flask we never did before. We also learnt about simbachain during the hackathon. We coded in solidity and learnt to solve a lot of bugs

# What's next for E-Cycle
Ai application for calculating rate and efficiency or recycling
GPS trackers to track delivery buses.
Front end also lol
